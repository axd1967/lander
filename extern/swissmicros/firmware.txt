Early models of the DM calculators (pre Sept 2012) have an LPC1114 CPU
with only 32k flash memory.
The firmware versions since V16 for the model DM15 no longer fit into
32k. These are the last 32k versions for the DM15:

Explanation of extended Memory versions There are three versions of
firmware for DM-15:

  * DM-15 firmware
  * DM-15 firmware 'M80' with extended memory
  * DM-15 firmware 'M1B' with even more memory


The first one is the same as original HP-15C, so it has exactly the same
amount of memory.
M80 and M1B firmware versions contain modified ROMs to enable bigger
amount of registers.
The hex number after MEM actually means the memory location where the
usable area for registers starts (memory location of NUT CPU).
The memory location of the original HP-15C ROM is at 0xC0; M1B and M80
use 0x1B or 0x80 respectively.

The difference can be seen on calc using [g] [MEM].
Note that recent M80 and M1B firmware versions have special display for
memory configuration including sizes of matrices.
Initial configurations should be:

DM15	19 	46 	0-0
DM15_M80	19 	110 	0-0
DM15_M1B	19 	211 	0-0


This also gives an idea about number of available memory.
If you accidentally don't know what this means, please, look into HP-15C
manual Appendix C - Memory allocation.

Firmware upgrade don't worry, it is not possible to break or brick the
calculator with this or any other upgrade procedure.

  * get FlashMagic <http://www.flashmagictool.com/>
  * install CP2102 driver under Windows, get it from here
    <http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/CP210x_VCP_Windows.zip>
    or here
    <http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/CP210x_VCP_Win_XP_S2K3_Vista_7.exe>
  * select device LPC1115/303 (or LPC1114/301 for calculators sold
    before June 2012)
  * choose correct COM port
  * set baud rate to 115200 or lower
  * select interface: none (ISP)
  * Oscillator (MHz): 12
  * check 'Erase all Flash+Code Rd Prot'
  * in the menu bar at the top of the FlashMagic screen, under
    "Options->Advanced Options->Hardware Config" check the box in front
    of "Use DTR and RTS to control RST and ISP pin"
  * connect the calculator with a standard miniUSB cable, preferably a
    shielded one. The calculator may be turned on or off before flashing
  * push and hold the PGM button through the right-hand pinhole on the
    backside with a needle and press Start to flash the firmware. the
    PGM button may be released after flashing has started
  * after flashing is done, push the RESET button through the left-hand
    pinhole on the backside

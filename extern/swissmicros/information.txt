Anodizing Titanium information

this is about aluminium, but a good illustraion of colour interferences
	


The colors produced by anodizing titanium are formed by the refraction
of light off of and through the thin titanium oxide layer that is
produced. These colors are called interference colors. There are no
pigments or dyes involved. In this process, the clear micronic oxide
layer (TiO2) that normally envelopes titanium (leaving the metal a gray
color) is electrically thickened by a very small amount. This clear
oxide filters out light waves, producing brilliant colors. creating
different refractive effects which the human eye perceives as different
colors. By controlling the application of electric currents and voltages
in different intensities and duration bring about the different
resulting colors, across the rainbow spectrum.

When the oxide is of a thickness to generate interference colors, its
depth is measured in angstroms (1?=10^-10 m). This layer can vary in
thickness from 500? to 1,000?+ depending on the color. It is not the
oxide itself that is perceived by the viewer, but its effect on light
waves.

Because colors are optically created you can see subtle differences in
the amount and/or shade of color from morning to twilight hours of the
day. The angle of viewing, and type of light source will also influence
color. The colors also change if the surface is wet or greasy.

Differences to the original

  * this calculator is NOT by HP
    <http://nonpareil.brouhaha.com/microcode_copyright_status/>!
  * it does not have all the bugs found in the HP-15C LE, see that bug
    list
    <http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/articles.cgi?read=1089>!
  * runs on a battery saving LPC1115 ARM processor emulating the NUT
    processor
  * uses one CR2032 battery (220mAh) which should last for many years in
    OFF-mode (~1.8uA), or several weeks with the display turned on
    (~120uA), or up to 50 hours continuously RUNNING at 12MHZ(~4mA) or
    about four times shorter at 48MHz
    in a real test with an endless loop the LCD faded and got dull after
    ~36h, the CPU still continued.
    the battery seems to recover after some minutes
  * runs up to 35 times faster (at 48MHZ) than the original calculator
    introduced back in 1982
  * matrix display 132*16 pixels
  * miniUSB-RS232 features a command line interface for saving and
    restoring complete calculator state.
  * en- and decode utility (html with jscript) <nut_decoder.html> to
    save and restore programs
  * reprogrammable through the miniUSB connection using FlashMagic
    <http://www.flashmagictool.com/> (runs also under Linux/Wine) or for
    Linux use the tool lpc21isp
    <http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpc21isp/> which we use too!
  * LCD operating temp. -10°C to +50°C (The response time will be slow
    below -20°, and the background will become darker at high
    temperature operating.)
